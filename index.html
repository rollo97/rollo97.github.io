	<p> Recently in sports news, an analyst by the name of Colin Cowherd has made adverse claims 
	about reigning MVP quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons Matt Ryan, calling him "Andy Dalton in a Dome". These claims
	are completely false and can be backed by the following data since Andy Dalton's rookie season": </P>
<table border=1> 
<tr> <TH> </TH> <TH> Yards </th> <th> Touchdowns </Th> <th> Interceptions </th> <th> Wins </th> <th> Playoff Wins </th> <th> MVPs </th> 
</tr>
<tr> <td> Matt Ryan </td> <td> 30, 012</td> <td> 187 </td> <td> 88 </td> <td> 57 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 1 </td>
</tr> 
<tr> <td> Andy Dalton </td> <td> 24,218 </td> <td> 155 </td> <td> 89 </td> <td> 59 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td>

 &nbsp;  <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DaltAn00.htm"> Andy Dalton's Stats </a> </div>
 <p> While Dalton may have a single regular season win more than Ryan, these numbers clearly don't lie, as Ryan's yards and touchdowns far surpass Dalton's. On top of that, Ryan has 3 career playoff wins, including a Super Bowl berth, while 
 Andy Dalton has never won a playoff game. Ryan also has an NFL Most Valuable Player Award to his name while Dalton has zero. </p>
 
 <p>Ryan is also the fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach 40,000 passing yards in only 151 career games, a record previously held by one of the greatest quarterbacks
 of all-time: Drew Brees (152 games). This further supports the claim that Ryan is a better quarterback than Andy Dalton as Dalton is currently on pace
 to reach 40,000 passing yards by 169 games; more than a full season longer than it took Ryan. </P>
